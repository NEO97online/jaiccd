Jai port of https://github.com/danfis/libccd

## Features

- [x] `ccdGJKIntersect`
- [x] `ccdGJKPenetration`
	- Working as long as the EPA tolerance isn't too low. At `0.0001` tolerance, getting an infinite loop. Maybe this is because of 32-bit float precision?
	- Seems to be giving the wrong position. Not sure if this is also an upstream libccd issue...
- [ ] `ccdMPRIntersect`
- [ ] `ccdMPRPenetration`
